                        </h1>
                            Here at BassLines we enjoy catching all fish and provide charters on the jersey shore for various types of fish. We are avalible for charters year round in various locations along the jersey shore. In the spring we are in the Raritan Bay, mainly targeting Stripped bass. In the summer we are based in Clarks Landing, offering off and in shore charters for a variety of fish such as tuna, mahi mahi and tile fish. In the fall we return to the Raritan Bay again for mainly Stripped bass. In the winter we are based in Lanoka harbor fishing for Black Fish.
