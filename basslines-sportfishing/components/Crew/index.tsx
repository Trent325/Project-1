                        Captain Bill has been fishing this area since he was a kid, so he knows the location of all the best fishing spots along the coast of New Jersey. With that map memorized, you could almost say he doesnâ€™t need GPS. Bill has an enormous amount of fishing wisdom under his belt and a passion for sharing it. From teaching the youngers how to cast, to helping anglers secure every fish they hook, Bill can and will do it all while smiling ear to ear.
